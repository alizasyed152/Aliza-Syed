Overview:
This project is a simple restaurant food menu web app built for Quiz 1. 
The website dynamically loads menu data from a JSON file using AJAX and jQuery.

Design Choices:
- The restaurant is styled as an elegant Italian trattoria.
- Used a table layout to meet quiz requirements for data presentation.
- The color palette (deep red, ivory, white) reflects classic Italian aesthetics.
- Semantic HTML used for accessibility and proper structure.

File Structure:
index.html – Landing page
data/menu.json – Contains food data in JSON format
resources/css/style.css – Styling for the webpage
resources/js/script.js – Handles AJAX data loading
resources/img/ – Contains food images

Observations:
- AJAX dynamically fetches the data, allowing future expansion.
- Semantic HTML ensures accessibility.
- CSS focuses on elegance, readability, and a professional restaurant vibe.
