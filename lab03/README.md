# Lab 3 README 

Aliza Syed

This lab focuses on creating a web application that consumes data from multiple APIs using JavaScript, AJAX, and JSON. I connected the OpenWeatherMap API with the Lewagon Bored API which generates an activity suggestion based on the weather. I struggled actually making the activity be based on the weather. I tried to add filters grouping the type of actiity and connecting it to different elements of the weather, but it was only like half sucessful.

Features

Display current weather for Troy, NY using OpenWeatherMap API.  
Fetch and display data from a second API 
Dynamic data rendering using JavaScript and AJAX.  
JSON data parsing and manipulation for easy display.  
Responsive and visually appealing interface using HTML/CSS
HTML5 Geolocation API to detect user location and show local weather (for extra credit).
