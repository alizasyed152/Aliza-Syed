Prompts: 

1) i need a website that uses openweathermpa api and the bored api, and it should default by      displaying the weather for troy ny with and associated activity based o the weather. it should use a white to light yellow to white gradient in as a background and then use cards to display the location, each element of the weather and the activity. there should also be a button to allow users to show the weather and associated activity using their location. can you give me html, css, and javascript files. thanks

Bored API – https://www.boredapi.com/ 

OpenWeatherMap API – https://openweathermap.org/api

2) do you need my api key so the content will actually generate?

3) can you rewrite my javascript file with my key so the content will actually load: a99233cfaaa96194e757897b529ffeab

4) why is it not working : Could not fetch data. Please try again later.

5) this is the correct link for the bored api: https://bored.api.lewagon.com/api/activity can you update the js

6) for the weather, can you make separate cards and use the data from the weather api to display max temp, min temp, feels like, conditions, humidity, temperature, pressure, wind, sunrise, and sunset

7) can you update the css to use this color pallette: https://coolors.co/1f2041-ffffff-fcfccc-6cb0ef-acadaf

8) can you also add an image that represents the conditons

9) okay and when the user chooses to use their location, where you display the city name should say the name of their location, not "your location"
